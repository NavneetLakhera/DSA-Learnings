## :books: **Introduction**
Hi there! My name is Navneet Lakhera, and I'm currently a second year student pursuing a Bacleors of computer applications at College of engineering roorkee (UETR). I'm excited to be learning new things and building my skills as a Software Developer through my coursework and personal projects.

## :books: **Daily DSA Practice**

Hey there! This repo is where I share my daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.I'm always trying to improve my skills in this area. I created this repo to showcase my dedication to DSA, and also to show that I know how to use Git and GitHub.

## :computer: **Overview**
So, basically, I'm working on DSA every day and adding my progress to this repo. I'm covering a bunch of different topics, like complexity analysis, algorithm design, and data structures. And, of course, I'm implementing different algorithms too, like sorting, searching, graphs, trees, and more.

## :pencil: **Technologies Used**
I'm using C++ for all my DSA practice, and I'm working in VS Code. And, since version control is key, I'm using Git and GitHub to keep everything organized.

## :bulb: **Daily Practice**
Every day, I'm adding something new to this repo. It might be a new concept I learned, an implementation of an algorithm, or a solution to a DSA problem from a popular coding platform like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksForGeeks.

## :rocket: **Conclusion**
This repo is my way of showing my love for software development and my commitment to becoming a better developer every day. I hope that by sharing my progress, you can see that I'm quick to learn new concepts, good at applying them, and able to work collaboratively with others using Git and GitHub. Thanks for checking it out!
